INTRODUCTION
------------

The Important Information module allows for the constant display of vital content to the site user. It provides 3 different ways for this vital content to always be in view for the user. The module can be configured to use any combination of the following 3 displays:

 - Important Information Sidebar: A block meant for use in a sidebar, using the Sticky-Sidebar JS library
 - Important Information Footer: A block meant for use in a footing footer, using CSS and JS to ensure its always at the bottom floating over the site
 - Important Information Bottom: A block meant for use embedded on the page, usually at the bottom

Generally speaking, a good way to ensure the Important Information content is always on the page is to use either the Sidebar or Footer for a page depending on how its regions are set up. In addition to using either the Sidebar or Footer to keep the information in view at all times, it may be a good idea to use
